    <h3>Downloading Example Data</h3>
    <p>For our first lesson, we'll be using stock ticker data from the New York Stock Exchange from the years 2000-2001. You can download this file here: <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/rjurney.public/NYSE-2000-2001.tsv.gz">https://s3.amazonaws.com/rjurney.public/NYSE-2000-2001.tsv</a>. The file is about 40 megabytes, and may take a few minutes to download. Fortunately, to learn 'Big Data' you don't have to use a massive dataset. You need only use tools that scale to massive datasets. Click and save this file to your computer.<p>
    <h3>Using the File Browser</h3>
    <p>You can reach the File Browser by clicking its icon, circled in yellow below:</p>

    <p>The File Browser interface should be familiar to you, it is similar to the file manager on a Windows PC or Mac. We begin in our home directory. This is where we'll store the results of our work. File Browser also lets us upload files.</p>
    <h3>Uploading a File</h3>
    <p>To upload the example data you just downloaded, select the 'Upload' button and then select 'File.'</p>
    <img width="80%" src="files/select_file_upload.gif" />
    <p>A pop-up window will appear. Click the button which says, 'Upload a file'. Locate the example data you downloaded and select it. A progress meter will appear, and the upload may take a few moments. When it is completed, you'll see this:</p>

    <p>Now click the file. You'll see it, displayed in tabular form:</p>

    <p>You can use file browser just like your own computer's file manager. Next, lets register our dataset with HCatalog.</p>

    <p>Select the HCatalog icon at the top of Hue:</p>
