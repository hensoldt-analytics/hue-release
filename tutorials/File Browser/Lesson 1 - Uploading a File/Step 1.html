    <p>For our first lesson, we'll be using stock ticker data from the New York Stock Exchange from the years 2000-2001. You can download this file here: <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/rjurney.public/NYSE-2000-2001.tsv.gz">https://s3.amazonaws.com/rjurney.public/NYSE-2000-2001.tsv.gz</a>. Don't worry - the compressed file is only about 11 megabytes. Fortunately, to learn 'Big Data' you don't have to use a massive dataset. You need only use tools that scale to massive datasets.<p>
